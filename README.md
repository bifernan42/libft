# Project Libft    

## [C Library Development, Standard Functions Reimplementation, Memory Management, String Manipulation, Linked Lists]  

In this project, we had to:  
- Implement **standard libc functions** like `strlen`, `memcpy`, `atoi`, and more with a `ft_` prefix  
- Develop **utility functions** such as `ft_split`, `ft_itoa`, and `ft_strtrim` for enhanced string handling  
- Manage **dynamic memory allocation** safely with `malloc`, `calloc`, and `free`  
- Create **a linked list API**, implementing operations like `ft_lstadd_front`, `ft_lstclear`, and `ft_lstmap`  
- Structure the project as a **static library (`libft.a`)** compiled using `ar`  

This project strengthened our understanding of **low-level C programming**, **manual memory management**, and **building reusable libraries**.
